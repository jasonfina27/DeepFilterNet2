**Usage:**

This demo takes a audio sample and enhances it using DeepFilterNet2.
You can either record a speech sample or alternatively provide one via upload.
Furthermore, you may optionally add some additional background noise to the input sample.
If no samples are provided, a default will be used.

DeepFilterNet2 [(link)](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet) is used to denoise the noisy mixture.
