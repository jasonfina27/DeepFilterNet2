**Usage:**

This demo takes a audio sample and enhances it using DeepFilterNet2.
Upload a (noisy) speech sample. You may optionally add some additional background noise to the input sample.
If no samples are provided, a default will be used.

Long audio files will be trimmed to 10s.

DeepFilterNet2 [(link)](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet) is used to denoise the noisy mixture.
